# Evidence from Google Trends of a Widening Second-level Digital Divide in Brazil
Background: While Brazilian governmental initiatives focused on home broadband Internet access, availability of computers for students in schools has been drastically reduced since 2010. Furthermore, the migration of studentsâ€™ Internet access to smartphones did not occur within schools, where its use is prohibited.  Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the increasing home and mobile Internet access on the reproduction or closing of existing educational inequalities. Design: This study made use of quantitative, locally statistical research to investigate the reproduction or closing of existing educational digital divide across already contrasting Brazilian regions. Setting and Participants: Child or adolescent from 9 to 17 years of age and their guardians. Data collection and analysis: Data was obtained from the CETIC.br data portal and the Google Trends webpage. Data were analysed by means of local geostatistical measures of spatial autocorrelation and inequality, as well as bivariate choropleth maps. Results: Our results suggest that the Brazilian school system is failing to cultivate in their students the more productive use of Internet access and contributing to the widening of the existing geographical second-level digital divide. Conclusions: Brazilian policymakers should concentrate efforts and resources in addressing the large-scale second-level digital divide in Internet use found in this study, possible by equipping educators and students with the knowledge and skills towards the educational, productive and responsible use of the Internet, as well as updating policies related to allowing mobile Internet access in school premises.
